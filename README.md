Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Real Estate Pricing: Unveiling the Dynamics of House Valuation in a Dynamic Market


Key Findings
1.	Data Overview: 
o	Using df.info() and df.describe(), you likely observed data types, missing values, and general statistical summaries for features like SalePrice, OverallQual, GrLivArea, and YearBuilt.
2.	Price Insights: 
o	The distribution of SalePrice (sns.histplot) revealed the spread and skewness of home prices, providing insights into price ranges and central tendency.
o	A new feature PricePerSqft was created, which allows price comparisons adjusted for home size.
3.	Quality Analysis: 
o	The OverallQual feature was visualized (sns.countplot), highlighting the most common quality ratings in the dataset.
4.	Correlation Analysis: 
o	A correlation matrix (sns.heatmap) showed relationships between key features, indicating which variables (e.g., GrLivArea, FullBath, BedroomAbvGr) are more correlated with SalePrice.
o	Specifically, GrLivArea (above-ground living area) displayed a strong correlation with SalePrice.
5.	Linear Relationships: 
o	Regression plots (sns.regplot) were generated for SalePrice vs. GrLivArea, confirming a linear relationship, which was further analyzed with a simple linear regression model.
6.	Time-based Analysis: 
o	A trend analysis was conducted using YearBuilt and average SalePrice to see how housing prices evolved over time, as well as plotting SalePrice sequentially.
7.	Pool and Garage Areas: 
o	The PoolArea and GarageArea features were visualized with their relationship to SalePrice, offering insights into how these attributes might add value to a property.
Challenges Encountered
1.	Missing Data: 
o	Itâ€™s common in housing datasets to encounter missing values in columns like PoolArea (many houses may not have pools) and GarageArea. This was handled by checking null values using df.isnull().sum(), though additional steps (e.g., imputing or excluding data) might be necessary.
2.	Data Normalization: 
o	Some variables may need transformation or normalization (e.g., SalePrice and GrLivArea may have skewed distributions), which may affect the accuracy of regression models and visualizations.
3.	Data Cleaning and Deduplication: 
o	Duplicates were removed using df.drop_duplicates(), which helps avoid skewing results and is critical in ensuring data integrity.
4.	Feature Engineering: 
o	Creating new features (Age, TotalSqft, Renovated) was necessary for deeper insights but required validation to ensure the assumptions behind these engineered features held true.
Adjustments to the Original Plan
1.	Refinement of the Regression Model: 
o	Multiple regression models were tested by adding features incrementally to see how GrLivArea, BedroomAbvGr, FullBath, PoolArea, and GarageArea influenced SalePrice. This helped refine the understanding of key predictive features.
2.	Sequential Index for Trend Analysis: 
o	An index was added to track SalePrice over a sequential timeline, allowing for a simple trend analysis without relying solely on chronological data like YearBuilt.
3.	Improved Visualizations: 
o	Various types of visualizations were used to capture different relationships in the data, such as distribution, count plots, scatterplots, and heatmaps. Adjustments were made based on findings, adding color (e.g., hue for PoolArea) to enhance interpretability.
4.	Final Model Refinement: 
o	The final model included features such as GrLivArea, BedroomAbvGr, FullBath, PoolArea, and GarageArea based on initial findings from correlation and regression analysis. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model provided statistical insights into feature importance and significance.
